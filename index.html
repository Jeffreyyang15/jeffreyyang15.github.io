<br>Hi, I am Jeffrey, who is currently studying at Shenzhen College of International Education. This introduction will briefly be introduced what I have learned, and what I am willing to do. To begin with, I participated Awesome Math summer program, in which the course I focused on was Computational geometry. Then, I participated in a reading project led by Dr.Chen Yang Yang, that is related to elementary number theory. However, Dr.Chen Yangyang has left Shenzhen, yet before he left, he introduced me to his friends Dr.Bao, & Dr.Tao, and I completed a reading project with them, related to Mathematical Analysis, Linear Algebra, and Abstract Algebra.</div>
